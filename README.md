Java console-based Pizza Billing System that calculates pizza cost with size, toppings, and input validation.
Pizza Billing System
Overview

The Pizza Billing System is a beginner-level Java console program.
It asks the user to choose a pizza size, add optional toppings like pepperoni and extra cheese, validates the inputs, and finally calculates the total bill.

**Features**

Choose pizza size: Small, Medium, or Large

Add pepperoni topping (extra charges depending on size)

Add extra cheese

Input validation with retry until correct entry

Displays the final bill clearly

**How It Works**

The user selects a pizza size: Small = 100, Medium = 200, Large = 300.

The program checks if the input is valid. If not, it asks again.

The user chooses if they want pepperoni or extra cheese.

Extra charges are added based on the choices.

The final bill is shown to the user.

**Sample Run**

Enter pizza size: mini
Invalid! Try again.

Enter pizza size: small
Do you want pepperoni? yes
Do you want extra cheese? no

Your final bill is: 130 rupees

**Concepts Used**

Loops (while, continue, break)

Conditional statements (if-else)

Input validation

Simple billing logic

Future Improvements

Add more toppings and offers

Allow multiple pizza orders in one bill
